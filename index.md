## Welcome!

This is the official page of the workshop **Distant Reading in Literary Studies. An Introduction to Tools for Data Literacy**, which will take place at Bielefeld University on December the 7th, 2022. The workshop is organised by the BiLinked Communities of Practice ["Data Literacy"](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/themen/bilinked/communities-of-practice/data-literacy/) and ["Open Humanities"](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/themen/bilinked/communities-of-practice/public-humanities/).

Here you can find [resources](resources.md) that will allow you to make the most of our workshop, as well as the [program](program.md).
You will also find some recommended readings, which might give you an idea of what Digital Literary Studies are about.

## Get ready

Please take your time to explore the different sections of this webpage, in particular the [resources](resources.md). While it is *not compulsory* to read the material provided here before the start of the workshop, we **highly recommend** that you get an idea of the approaches and tools that are typically used in Digital Humanities to investigate different aspects of literary texts.

In particular, **if you are completely new to R and R Studio** -- for instance if you are asking yourself, *" R what..?!?"* -- we think **it might be very useful for you to start familiarising with these tools** and their interfaces, as you will be using them during most of the workshop.
Unless you have R and R Studio already on your computer, you will be able to do everything on the free "cloud" version of R Studio, which you can find and access [here](https://rstudio.cloud).

Yes, we will still go through all the basics with you at the beginning of the workshop, with sessions dedicated almost exclusively to making you at least comfortable with R Studio. Nonetheless, it can be quite overwhelming to "get into" it, all of a sudden, within one morning.

To make the impact a little smoother, we suggest that you go have a look at some of the many existing tutorials offering an introduction to R and R Studio, such as [this (pdf)](resources/R_RStudio_Basics.pdf), or [this (online)](https://moderndive.netlify.app/1-getting-started.html).
You will find more links in the [resources](resources.md) section.

## Help us give you the best experience

The workshop will help you discover the potential of DH tools and approaches, showing you how a corpus of texts can be used to obtain new insights and perspectives on aspects of literature that are otherwise difficult to identify and examine, with a particular focus on the analysis of literary affect and space.
